Using the model completed in class perform simulations, describe them and interpret:

1. Run a simulation of an increase of one factor's endowment.

2. Run a simulation of a uniform tax on all sectors/factors.

3. How are the results different from when you introduced the tax on only one good and factor When taxes are distortionary?

Submit a written description together with tables or graphs illustrating the results and the model code. The limit on the size of the upload is 10 MB.
