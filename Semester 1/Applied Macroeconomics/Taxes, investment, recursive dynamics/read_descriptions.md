Part 1:

1. Take model 3.1 and run a base simulation (no changes in taxes).

2. Simulate introduction of non-zero tax on capital in production of good 1. 

3. Now instead, introduce the same tax on capital used in all goods so that the government revenues are the same (do it iteratively).

4. HOMEWORK:

(a) Compare results from 1 and 3 by describing changes in the simulated economy. Comment on the differences between 2. and 3. Remember: always refer to the situation from base simulation. 

(b) How to do the shift between 2 and 3 automatically?

Part 2

2. Introduce an exogeneous increase of government consumption and comment on the results. Do it in two versions:

(a) With a corresponding increase of government deficit.

(b) With a corresponding increase of income tax (introduce INC_SHIFT variable)

3. Find out what happens to the economy after three periods after the shock. Focus on investment, capital and GDP changes.

4. HOMEWORK (continued):

(a) Comment on results of a. and b from previous 2 (Part 2). 

(b) EXTRA CREDIT: Run a tax-replacement scenario: cut the income taxes by 5pp at the same time increasing a tax on capital in production of good 4. Make sure that government consumption remains unchanged. Comment on the results
